# Log Analysis with Google Generative AI

This Python script uses Google Generative AI (gemini-1.5-flash) to analyze system logs and explain issues in simple terms. The AI model processes the logs, removes sensitive data, and generates a layman-friendly explanation for any detected issues.

## Features

- Removes sensitive IP data from logs
- Uses Google Generative AI for log analysis
- Identifies system issues in logs and provides explanations in simple terms

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MyFaduGame/Log-Detection-Genai.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

3. Set up your Google Generative AI API key. Replace `your-api-key` with your actual API key in the script:
